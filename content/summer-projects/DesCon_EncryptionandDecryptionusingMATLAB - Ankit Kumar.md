# Write a brief summary of the project
summary: In this project, our main aim was to implement and create ciphers in MATLAB using both classical and modern techniques. We started with MATLAB basics, progressed through various ciphers and advanced to image and audio encryption.At the end everyone created a unique cipher, blending programming with cryptographic principles
