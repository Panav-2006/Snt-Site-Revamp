# Write a brief summary of the project
summary: This project invites participants to explore the world of 3-D car modeling by using Autodesk Fusion 360. The experience begins with hands-on design work in Fusion 360, where creativity meets technical skill in crafting sleek car models. These digital designs are then brought to life through 3D printing. The initiative aims to build proficiency in Fusion 360 by guiding participants through structured design projects, culminating in the tangible creation of their car models.
