# Write a brief summary of the project
summary: The Magnus Plane uses rotating cylinders to generate lift through the Magnus effect instead of traditional wings. The plane features four cylinders, each 45 cm in length, driven by 1400kv thrusters. It has a total weight of 1.8 kg and a dimension of 100 cm x 100 cm. The design enables short takeoffs, landings, and efficient low-speed flight. Theoretical calculations predict a lift force of 2.97 kg under optimalÂ conditions.
