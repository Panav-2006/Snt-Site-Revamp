# Write a brief summary of the project
summary: The project covered foundational concepts of version control, providing a solid understanding of Git and its inner workings. It explored Git objects, HEAD, branching, merging, and commands such as git diff, git status, git log, git add, git commit, git branch, git merge, git remote, git fetch, and git push. The internal workings of these commands were studied, and a custom version control system was implemented in Go, incorporating these commands to enhance understanding of development and project structuring.
