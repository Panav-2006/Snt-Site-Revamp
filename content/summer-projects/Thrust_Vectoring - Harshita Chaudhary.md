# Write a brief summary of the project
summary: The Thrust Vectoring project involves creating a scale model inspired by the F-22 jet, focusing on enhancing flight maneuverability through thrust vectoring. Key specifications include a 100 cm wingspan, 145 cm fuselage length, and electronics featuring dual 40-amp ESCs, a Lipo 4S 2200mAh battery, and 4 micro servos. The model is designed to explore innovative aircraft design and improve agility in flight.
