# Write a brief summary of the project
summary: The project aimed to develop a full fledged backtesting engine with multiple risk management measures to ease out the process of backtesting. The QuantWeb backtesting engine also allowed the user to create his/her own strategy using the create your own strategy method. This was achieved with the help of Django.
