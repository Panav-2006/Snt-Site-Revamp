## About us
Programming Club (or PClub) is a community of students highly enthusiastic about coding, ethical hacking, Web Designing and all other aspects of programming. We are a team currently of 4 coordinators (pre-final year) and 24 secretaries (sophomores).

Our Instagram page boasts around 1.7K followers and is a hub for programming-related posts and information. We use it to share exciting updates, promote events, engage with our community, and put out informative posts that keep our followers up-to-date on the latest in the programming world.

We organize activities related to Development (Web Development, Open Source, Game/App Development), programming contests, hackathons, Capture The Flag contests, et all. Lecture series are regularly taken on algorithms, web hijacking, development, among other things.

Programming Club is also dedicated to developing various applications that are beneficial for the campus junta, such as Puppy Love (during Valentineâ€™s week), Student Search, Linux Install fest, and promoting open-source software.

During summers, we offer a large number of projects to the first year students through our Summer Camp. The 2022 Summer Camp saw close to 300 applicants.
