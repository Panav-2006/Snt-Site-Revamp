summary: The Brain & Cognitive Society (BCS@IITK) is a student society at IIT Kanpur. We aim at studying Brain Science to reverse engineer human intelligence to create more general and intelligent AI's for the future world. To achieve this we try to probe it from both ways developing better computational models of human cognition and relating the individual functionality of artificial computational models with that of humans.

## About Us

The Brain & Cognitive Society (BCS@IITK) is a student society at IIT Kanpur. We aim at studying Brain Science to reverse engineer human intelligence to create more general and intelligent AI's for the future world. To achieve this we try to probe it from both ways: developing better computational models of human cognition and relating the individual functionality of artificial computational models with that of humans. Our work is highly interdisciplinary and thrives at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computational cognition. Throughout the semester we carry out various activities like journal club meetings, semester long projects and invited talks to engage with the campus junta and develop a culture for exploring this fascinating realm of brain and cognitive science.
