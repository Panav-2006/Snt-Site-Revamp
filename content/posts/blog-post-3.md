summary: The astronomy club attempts to bring about an interest and awareness in the field of Astronomy and Space Research. We intend to promote amateur astronomy through talks, competitions and shows. Astronomy is fun, but it gets better when you are a part of it as a community. Through various observation sessions by telescope at The Observatory for Astronomical Research (OAAR), we impart hands on skills and knowledge to all those willing to learn.
