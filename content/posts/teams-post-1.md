summary: Currently, we are developing a fleet of autonomous aerial vehicles which can which can perform various tasks with state-of-the-art controls and algorithms at its core. Our current focus is on navigation, localization & mapping . Since navigating in indoor areas with accuracy can’t only be relied on GPS, So robot is getting its odometry data by multi-sensor-fusion using GPS, IMU and Visual methods.

## About Us
Currently, we are developing a fleet of autonomous aerial vehicles which can which can perform various tasks with state-of-the-art controls and algorithms at its core. Our current focus is on navigation, localization & mapping . Since navigating in indoor areas with accuracy can’t only be relied on GPS, So robot is getting its odometry data by multi-sensor-fusion using GPS, IMU and Visual methods. Apart from this we aim to implement deep learning algorithms for advanced controls and object detection/feature extraction for various uses in precision agriculture and detection of different objects from a given person or landmark. We desire to keep all our computation onboard to increase the real life application and reliability of our system.
