## <h2>What is the council about?</h2>

With the thought, “Imagination is more important than knowledge”, we, the Science and Technology Council compel each and everyone to think beyond the conventional boundaries, provide support, opportunity to help one unleash their imagination and an ideal platform to showcase one’s talent. We make things fly, we carve out mighty business plans, we build electronic gadgets, our own communication devices, we dare to stare deep into the sky not only to admire the cosmic wonder, but a lot more; we write our own codes, and yes we do make our own robots! Well, if by remote chance none of this is your cup of tea, then why not indulge in a game of fox hunt or simply enjoy a joyride on one of the gliders. There is surely something for everyone!<br>
