      <description>Our club aims to spread financial literacy amongst the campus community &amp;amp; aspires to make everyone adept in handling Personal Finances. We work at the merger of finance and analytics applying analytical understandings and tools in the areas of finance and economics. In the era of digitalization, rapid growth opportunities in fintech industries have sprung. Triumphing for these opportunities requires relevant skills and domain knowledge, which ranges from understanding basic financial statements to capital markets, Corporate Finance, Econometrics, art of investing, building trading ideas, strategies and FAC (IITK) feels humbled in covering these. The FAC (IITK) timetable is circumscribed with engaging activities throughout the year including lectures, presentations, summer projects, assignments, workshops, seminars on certifications, &amp;amp; guest speakers.</description>
