We provide a platform to the students’ body where any individual with an idea can approach the club freely to grasp the necessary technical skills required to turn that idea into a reality.</description>

      <description>Programming is an art required in almost all spheres of life, and we inculcate that talent in the people who want to learn it. Introductory lectures and workshops cater to the people who are willing to learn coding. On the other hand, highly motivated and knowledgeable people are provided with necessary equipment/resources for their project. We organize activities ranging from App Development, Hacking to Algorithm development and Gaming.</description>
